# Parallel-computing-hw06
In assignment #4, we have implemented data normalization & cross validation with kNN. In this assignment, we are
going to most steps of kNN & n-fold cross validation with OpenCL.

## Dependencies
* Ubuntu
* g++
* Valgrind 
* OpenCL

## Setup
```sh
make all        -- Produce executable file

-- Feed dataset 01 to 05 and get results
